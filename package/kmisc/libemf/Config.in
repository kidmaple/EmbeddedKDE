	  libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into StarOffice/OpenOffice.org. The Enhanced MetaFile (EMF) is one of the two color vector graphics format which is "vectorially" understood by SO/OO.org. (SO/OO.org can import Encapsulated PostScript files, but will only display it if it has a bitmap preview image. SO/OO.org can also import a DXF file, but as near as I can tell, this is only monochrome. OpenOffice now has an XML based file format; in the future, use of this format will probably supplant this library.) The EMF format also has the additional advantage that it can be "broken" into its constituent components and edited like any other SO/OO.org graphics object.
