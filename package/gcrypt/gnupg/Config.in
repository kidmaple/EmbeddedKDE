	  GnuPG Made Easy (GNUPG) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its backend but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact we have already developed a backend for CMS (S/MIME).
